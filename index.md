title: Building an e-Ink ToDo list
date: 2022-12-25
---

First post!

This is an eInk screen in a picture frame on my wall, that displays my todo list from an app on my phone. I've decided to try to minimize the amount of time I spend looking at LCD and interactive screens, and this is a step on that path.

I learned about a new ecosystem (Home Assistant, ESPHome, ESP32). I'm very impressed at the advances they've made in devex.

I'm also excited that e-Ink is becoming affordable for hobby electronics! Hopefully this is the start of a rapid reduction in price.

### Software

* [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
* [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/)
* [CloudFlare Tunnel](https://peyanski.com/connecting-cloudflare-tunnel-to-home-assistant/) 
* [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)
* [Todoist](https://todoist.com/)

## Physical Setup

### Electronics

* Connect the screen to the driver board (don't get any cables backwards, this wasted 4 hours of my life). 
* Connect the driver board to the cable (even if the cable says it's a data cable, it might not be. This wasted 4 hours of my life.) 
* Connect the cable to a keep-alive board (this delayed me 2 weeks waiting for a part...). 
* Connect the keep-alive board to the power bank.

Pro-tip: if nothing is working, try the WaveShare demo codebase, first, and once you can get the screen working there, _then_ try the full ESPHome + Home Assistant integration.

I ran into the following error: ```[E][waveshare_epaper:119]: Timeout while displaying image!```. Turns out I had reattached a ribbon cable upside down.

### Frame
I used a frame from Michaels. Unfortunately, my power bank was too thick, so I added some extra depth to it. 

I also added some spacers to hold everything in place, and a bit of cardboard between the display and the rest of the electronics.

## Digital Setup

* Set up Home Assistant.
* Set up ESPHome
* Set up a [CloudFlare tunnel](https://peyanski.com/connecting-cloudflare-tunnel-to-home-assistant/) so you can access your HA dashboard from anywhere. (And flash ESPs from anywhere.)
* Set up device on ESPHome, download the binary.
* Set up esphomeflasher, to flash basic setup on the waveshare board.
* Set up Todoist.

### Set up Todoist, retrieve your API Token
Get your Todoist API token [here](https://todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/developer), and put it into your Home Assistant config where I have "REDACTED".

### Setting up Home Assistant
I had to [set up Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/) because this was my first project. I quite like it!

I did need to buy a 50' long ethernet cable and attach an old RPi to my monitor for a while to get through the setup.

If you need help, the home assistant forums and discord, and the ESPHome discord, are welcoming, although somewhat curmudgeonly. It's all volunteers, and a lot of people want their help. You'll make people like you if you read the documentation thoroughly before hand, include all your configuration and code snippets, and describe what you've already tried. If you can, try to answer someone else's questions while you're there.

### Config for Home Assistant
A few hacks here:
* We use the command line and CURL with an echo to convert the list Todoist returns to a dictionary (because that's what Home Assistant can handle).
* We only put the length in the sensor's value, because Home Assistant sensors have a 255 character max
* We split out 10 sensors explicitly because there's no way to have a dynamically sized number of sensors.
* I'm using "todo\_list\_2" because a previous version of the sensor has taken the name. I tried using SQL Delete commands to get rid of the old sensor, but the sensor stayed with this new name.

### Set up ESPHome

The instructions to [setup ESPHome with Home Assistant](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html) are good.

I unfortunately ran into some trouble, and needed to use [esphomeflasher](https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher), and download the bin from ESPHome (Install -> Manual Download -> Legacy Format), the first time, to get things running.

If using ESPHome flasher gets too hard, look for guides to using pip3, and try installing the packages that are missing, and google the error messages.

### Config for ESPHome

Hacks:
* the ```reset_duration: 2ms``` is necessary for this type of WaveShare display...
* the default list of glyphs doesn't contain many that I use in my regular life (e.g., question marks)
* by setting deep sleep, we save a lot of battery life, but we unfortunately trick the battery into going to sleep too.
* when updating, I need to unplug the ESP32 from the battery and then plug it in before the upload happens. It typically takes 125 seconds before uploading, so waiting 100 seconds and then plugging it in usually works.
* the pinout for the ESP32 driver board HAT can be [found on page 2 of the manual](https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/4/4a/E-Paper_ESP32_Driver_Board_user_manual_en.pdf)

The error message "Encountered character without representation in font" was related to not having set the [glyphs](https://esphome.io/components/display/index.html#fonts) configuration variable for the font. I'll try to get an improvement to this message checked in.

### Add device to Home Assistant
You may need to [manually add the device to home assistant](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html#connecting-your-device-to-home-assistant) to read the sensor attributes.

### Thoughts on what can be improved about the ecosystem
It's clear that this ecosystem was built by people who think "no dynamic sizing" is a pillar of good design. You know: hardware folks who want their systems to work every time, to avoid killing people. It also means there are some rough edges at the boundary between software and hardware, e.g., I needed to hard-code 10 sensors and needed to use echo to convert a JSON list into a dictionary.

I'll keep thinking on ways this could have been improved (e.g., supporting lists in their json parsing template language, or allowing sensors to be instantiated using a list comprehension).

Otherwise: ESPHome lacked an interactive debugger. Home Assistant has a nice little interface for evaluating sensors and making sure you've gotten naming right, and provides a nice integration with VSCode. I'll continue to ponder how this could have gone better.

The other thing that bit me was sometimes opaque error messages that were not googleable (either because Discord isn't indexed, or because no one has had that issue.) For one case, I'm working on a PR to improve the error message around missing character representations.
